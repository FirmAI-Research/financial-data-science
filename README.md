# Investment Data Science

## Code* [examples](examples) (as jupyter notebooks in this main folder)

This repo contains examples and code (in python) exploring data science and machine learning methods
on large or textual financial data sets.  Questions and suggestions are welcome through

(but will endeavour to backfill, with apologies in advance) from whom I have applied ideas.
Only the code herein and all errors are my own._
